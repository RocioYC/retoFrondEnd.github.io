                <h3>About Whimsical</h3>
                <p> Whimsical was founded in 2017 by Kaspars Dancis and Steve Schoeffel to help teams be more effective
                    in the distributed and fully digital work environment.</p>
                <p>Whimsical's product is expressive, fast, and delightful. We believe that software should spark joy,
                    not
                    dread.</p>
                <p>We are a remote-first company and big proponents of remote work because it democratizes the
                    opportunities for people everywhere.</p>
                <p>Our operating philosophy is based on set of core principles, such as:</p>
                <div>
                    <ul>
                        <li> <b>Sustainability:</b> We don't believe in growth at all costs. Growth is a fundamental
                            part of a healthy
                            existence but we want it to be in balance with sustainability and bounded by ethical
                            behavior. We strive
                            to work calm, 40-hour work weeks. Whimsical is also committed to doing our part towards a
                            sustainable
                            future for the planet.</li>
                        <li><b>Craftsmanship:</b> We care deeply about our work. We are specialists, eager learners, and
                            persistent in our
                            pursuit of quality work. We're patient and committed because building great things takes
                            time.</li>
                        <li><b>Long-term focus:</b> We're building Whimsical for the long-haul, not a quick exit. We
                            avoid shortcuts and
                            consider every key decision from a 10+ year perspective.</li>
                        <li><b>Partnership Mindset:</b> We’ve built the company around the idea that everybody who joins
                            us should feel
                            like they are partners in the business. Time is precious and we want Whimsical to be the
                            place where
                            people invest their time rather than sell it. Our equity offers are 100% transparent and
                            above market
                            average. We also pay everyone at the same level the same salary, no matter where they live.
                        </li>

                            When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay
                            to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have
                            to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work
                            online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually
                            talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain
                            name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote
                            work are rampant, be careful!<b><u>Read more to avoid scams.</u></b>  When clicking on the button to apply
